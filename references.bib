It shows how causality has grown from a nebulous concept into a mathematical theory with significant applications in the fields of statistics, artificial intelligence, economics, philosophy, cognitive science, and the health and social sciences. Judea Pearl presents and unifies the probabilistic, manipulative, counterfactual, and structural approaches to causation and devises simple mathematical tools for studying the relationships between causal connections and statistical associations. Cited in more than 2,100 scientific publications, it continues to liberate scientists from the traditional molds of statistical thinking. In this revised edition, Judea Pearl elucidates thorny issues, answers readers' questions, and offers a panoramic view of recent advances in this field of research. Causality will be of interest to students and professionals in a wide variety of fields.

              : In this article, we discuss causal inference when there are multiple versions of treatment. The potential outcomes framework, as articulated by Rubin, makes an assumption of no multiple versions of treatment, and here we discuss an extension of this potential outcomes framework to accommodate causal inference under violations of this assumption. A variety of examples are discussed in which the assumption may be violated. Identification results are provided for the overall treatment effect and the effect of treatment on the treated when multiple versions of treatment are present and also for the causal effect comparing a version of one treatment to some other version of the same or a different treatment. Further identification and interpretative results are given for cases in which the version precedes the treatment as when an underlying treatment variable is coarsened or dichotomized to create a new treatment variable for which there are effectively “multiple versions”. Results are also given for effects defined by setting the version of treatment to a prespecified distribution. Some of the identification results bear resemblance to identification results in the literature on direct and indirect effects. We describe some settings in which ignoring multiple versions of treatment, even when present, will not lead to incorrect inferences.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Marginal Structural Models (MSMs), with the associated method of inverse probability weighting (IPW), have become increasingly popular in epidemiology to model and estimate the joint effects of a sequence of exposures. This popularity is largely related to the relative simplicity of the method, as compared to other techniques to adjust for time-varying confounding, such as g-estimation and g-computation. However, the price to pay for this simplicity can be substantial. The IPW estimators that are routinely used in applications make inefficient use of the information in the data, and are susceptible to large finite-sample bias when some confounders are strongly predictive of exposure. Moreover, the handling of continuous exposures easily becomes impractical, and the study of effect modification by time-varying covariates even impossible. In view of this, we revisit Structural Nested Mean Models (SNMMs) with the associated method of g-estimation as a useful remedy, and show how this can be implemented through standard software.},

	abstract = {Correlation does not imply causation; but often, observational data are the only option, even though the research question at hand involves causality. This article discusses causal inference based on observational data, introducing readers to graphical causal models that can provide a powerful tool for thinking more clearly about the interrelations between variables. Topics covered include the rationale behind the statistical control of third variables, common procedures for statistical control, and what can go wrong during their implementation. Certain types of third variables—colliders and mediators—should not be controlled for because that can actually move the estimate of an association away from the value of the causal effect of interest. More subtle variations of such harmful control include using unrepresentative samples, which can undermine the validity of causal conclusions, and statistically controlling for mediators. Drawing valid causal inferences on the basis of observational data is not a mechanistic procedure but rather always depends on assumptions that require domain knowledge and that can be more or less plausible. However, this caveat holds not only for research based on observational data, but for all empirical research endeavors.},

	abstract = {Summary
            When regression models adjust for mediators on the causal path from exposure to outcome, the regression coefficient of exposure is commonly viewed as a measure of the direct exposure effect. This interpretation can be misleading, even with a randomly assigned exposure. This is because adjustment for post-exposure measurements introduces bias whenever their association with the outcome is confounded by more than just the exposure. By the same token, adjustment for such confounders stays problematic when these are themselves affected by the exposure. Robins accommodated this by introducing linear structural nested direct effect models with direct effect parameters that can be estimated by using inverse probability weighting by a conditional distribution of the mediator. The resulting estimators are consistent, but inefficient, and can be extremely unstable when the mediator is absolutely continuous. We develop direct effect estimators which are not only more efficient but also consistent under a less demanding model for a conditional expectation of the outcome. We find that the one estimator which avoids inverse probability weighting altogether performs best. This estimator is intuitive, computationally straightforward and, as demonstrated by simulation, competes extremely well with ordinary least squares estimators in settings where standard regression is valid.},

Model diagrams used with structural equation models (SEMs) and causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) can guide causal-inference research. SEM diagrams and DAGs share visual similarities, often leading researchers familiar with one to wonder how the other differs. This article is intended to serve as a guide for researchers in the psychological sciences and psychiatric epidemiology on the distinctions between these methods. We offer high-level overviews of SEMs and causal DAGs using a guiding example. We then compare and contrast the two methodologies and describe when each would be used. In brief, SEM diagrams are both a conceptual and statistical tool in which a model is drawn and then tested, whereas causal DAGs are exclusively conceptual tools used to help guide researchers in developing an analytic strategy and interpreting results. Causal DAGs are explicitly tools for causal inference, whereas the results of a SEM are only sometimes interpreted causally. A DAG may be thought of as a “qualitative schematic” for some SEMs, whereas SEMs may be thought of as an “algebraic system” for a causal DAG. As psychology begins to adopt more causal-modeling concepts and psychiatric epidemiology begins to adopt more latent-variable concepts, the ability of researchers to understand and possibly combine both of these tools is valuable. Using an applied example, we provide sample analyses, code, and write-ups for both SEM and causal DAG approaches.},

              Purpose
              Ideally, the objectives of a pharmacoepidemiologic comparative effectiveness or safety study should dictate its design and data analysis. This paper discusses how defining an estimand is instrumental to this process.
            
            
              Methods
              
                We applied the ICH‐E9 (
                Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials
                ) R1 addendum on estimands – which originally focused on randomized trials – to three examples of observational pharmacoepidemiologic comparative effectiveness and safety studies. Five key elements specify the estimand: the population, contrasted treatments, endpoint, intercurrent events, and population‐level summary measure.
              
            
            
              Results
              Different estimands were defined for case studies representing three types of pharmacological treatments: (1) single‐dose treatments using a case study about the effect of influenza vaccination versus no vaccination on mortality risk in an adult population of ≥60 years of age; (2) sustained‐treatments using a case study about the effect of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor versus glucagon‐like peptide‐1 agonist on hypoglycemia risk in treatment of uncontrolled diabetes; and (3) as needed treatments using a case study on the effect of nitroglycerin spray as‐needed versus no nitroglycerin on syncope risk in treatment of stabile angina pectoris.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The case studies illustrated that a seemingly clear research question can still be open to multiple interpretations. Defining an estimand ensures that the study targets a treatment effect that aligns with the treatment decision the study aims to inform. Estimand definitions further help to inform choices regarding study design and data‐analysis and clarify how to interpret study findings.},

              Purpose
              In studies of effects of time‐varying drug exposures, adequate adjustment for time‐varying covariates is often necessary to properly control for confounding. However, the granularity of the available covariate data may not be sufficiently fine, for example when covariates are measured for participants only when their exposure levels change.
            
            
              Methods
              To illustrate the impact of choices regarding the frequency of measuring time‐varying covariates, we simulated data for a large target trial and for large observational studies, varying in covariate measurement design. Covariates were measured never, on a fixed‐interval basis, or each time the exposure level switched. For the analysis, it was assumed that covariates remain constant in periods of no measurement. Cumulative survival probabilities for continuous exposure and non‐exposure were estimated using inverse probability weighting to adjust for time‐varying confounding, with special emphasis on the difference between 5‐year event risks.
            
            
              Results
              With monthly covariate measurements, estimates based on observational data coincided with trial‐based estimates, with 5‐year risk differences being zero. Without measurement of baseline or post‐baseline covariates, this risk difference was estimated to be 49\% based on the available observational data. With measurements on a fixed‐interval basis only, 5‐year risk differences deviated from the null, to 29\% for 6‐monthly measurements, and with magnitude increasing up to 35\% as the interval length increased. Risk difference estimates diverged from the null to as low as −18\% when covariates were measured depending on exposure level switching.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Our simulations highlight the need for careful consideration of time‐varying covariates in designing studies on time‐varying exposures. We caution against implementing designs with long intervals between measurements. The maximum length required will depend on the rates at which treatments and covariates change, with higher rates requiring shorter measurement intervals.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Selecting an appropriate set of confounders for which to control is critical for reliable causal inference. Recent theoretical and methodological developments have helped clarify a number of principles of confounder selection. When complete knowledge of a causal diagram relating all covariates to each other is available, graphical rules can be used to make decisions about covariate control. Unfortunately, such complete knowledge is often unavailable. This paper puts forward a practical approach to confounder selection decisions when the somewhat less stringent assumption is made that knowledge is available for each covariate whether it is a cause of the exposure, and whether it is a cause of the outcome. Based on recent theoretically justified developments in the causal inference literature, the following proposal is made for covariate control decisions: control for each covariate that is a cause of the exposure, or of the outcome, or of both; exclude from this set any variable known to be an instrumental variable; and include as a covariate any proxy for an unmeasured variable that is a common cause of both the exposure and the outcome. Various principles of confounder selection are then further related to statistical covariate selection methods.},

	abstract = {Background:
              Causal inference continues to be a critical aspect of evaluation research. Recent research in causal inference for statistical mediation has focused on addressing the sequential ignorability assumption; specifically, that there is no confounding between the mediator and the outcome variable.
            
            
              Objectives:
              This article compares and contrasts three different methods for assessing sensitivity to confounding and describes the graphical depiction of these methods.
            
            
              Design:
              Two types of data were used to fully examine the plots for sensitivity analysis. The first type was generated data from a single mediator model with a confounder influencing both the mediator and the outcome variable. The second was data from an actual intervention study. With both types of data, situations are examined where confounding has a large effect and a small effect.
            
            
              Subjects:
              The nonsimulated data were from a large intervention study to decrease intentions to use steroids among high school football players. We demonstrate one situation where confounding is likely and another situation where confounding is unlikely.
            
            
              Conclusions:
              We discuss how these methods could be implemented in future mediation studies as well as the limitations and future directions for these methods.},

	abstract = {Simulation studies are computer experiments that involve creating data by pseudo‐random sampling. A key strength of simulation studies is the ability to understand the behavior of statistical methods because some “truth” (usually some parameter/s of interest) is known from the process of generating the data. This allows us to consider properties of methods, such as bias. While widely used, simulation studies are often poorly designed, analyzed, and reported. This tutorial outlines the rationale for using simulation studies and offers guidance for design, execution, analysis, reporting, and presentation. In particular, this tutorial provides a structured approach for planning and reporting simulation studies, which involves defining aims, data‐generating mechanisms, estimands, methods, and performance measures (“ADEMP”); coherent terminology for simulation studies; guidance on coding simulation studies; a critical discussion of key performance measures and their estimation; guidance on structuring tabular and graphical presentation of results; and new graphical presentations. With a view to describing recent practice, we review 100 articles taken from Volume 34 of
              Statistics in Medicine
