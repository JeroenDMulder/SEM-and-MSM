	abstract = {It is useful to investigate factors that could predict treatment outcomes for PTSD. The current study aims to investigate the relationship between daily measured PTSD symptoms during an intensive six-day treatment program and overall post-treatment outcomes. The treatment program combines eye movement desensitization with reprocessing and prolonged exposure, as well as physical activity and psychoeducation. It was expected that for the entire duration of treatment, as well as the first half of the treatment, a greater decline in daily PTSD symptoms would be a predictor for a greater decline in PTSD symptoms at a four-week follow-up. Data from 109 PTSD-patients (87.2\% female, mean age = 36.9, SD = 11.5) were used. PTSD symptoms were measured with the CAPS-5 and the self-reported PTSD checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). Daily PTSD symptoms were measured with an abbreviated version of the PCL-5 (8-item PCL). Latent growth curve models were used to describe changes in daily PTSD symptoms and predict treatment outcome. Results show that a greater decline in daily PTSD symptoms measured by the 8-item PCL predicts better treatment outcome (CAPS-5 and PCL-5), but that a patient’s PTSD symptoms on the first day of treatment has no predictive effect. A decline in PTSD symptoms only during the first half of treatment was also found to predict treatment outcomes. Future research should be focused on replicating the results of the current study.},

Following a standard format, chapters review the theoretical underpinnings, strengths, and limitations of the various models; present data examples; and demonstrate each model's application and interpretation in Mplus, with numerous screen shots and output excerpts. Coverage encompasses both traditional models (autoregressive, change score, and growth curve models) and LST models, for analyzing single- and multiple-indicator data. The book discusses measurement equivalence testing, intensive longitudinal data modeling, and missing data handling, and provides strategies for model selection and reporting of results. User-friendly features include special-topic boxes, chapter summaries, and suggestions for further reading. The companion website features data sets, annotated syntax files, and output for all of the examples"--},

It shows how causality has grown from a nebulous concept into a mathematical theory with significant applications in the fields of statistics, artificial intelligence, economics, philosophy, cognitive science, and the health and social sciences. Judea Pearl presents and unifies the probabilistic, manipulative, counterfactual, and structural approaches to causation and devises simple mathematical tools for studying the relationships between causal connections and statistical associations. Cited in more than 2,100 scientific publications, it continues to liberate scientists from the traditional molds of statistical thinking. In this revised edition, Judea Pearl elucidates thorny issues, answers readers' questions, and offers a panoramic view of recent advances in this field of research. Causality will be of interest to students and professionals in a wide variety of fields. Dr Judea Pearl has received the 2011 Rumelhart Prize for his leading research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and systems from The Cognitive Science Society.},

            Non-manipulable factors, such as gender or race have posed conceptual and practical challenges to causal analysts. On the one hand these factors do have consequences, and on the other hand, they do not fit into the experimentalist conception of causation.

              : In this article, we discuss causal inference when there are multiple versions of treatment. The potential outcomes framework, as articulated by Rubin, makes an assumption of no multiple versions of treatment, and here we discuss an extension of this potential outcomes framework to accommodate causal inference under violations of this assumption. A variety of examples are discussed in which the assumption may be violated. Identification results are provided for the overall treatment effect and the effect of treatment on the treated when multiple versions of treatment are present and also for the causal effect comparing a version of one treatment to some other version of the same or a different treatment. Further identification and interpretative results are given for cases in which the version precedes the treatment as when an underlying treatment variable is coarsened or dichotomized to create a new treatment variable for which there are effectively “multiple versions”. Results are also given for effects defined by setting the version of treatment to a prespecified distribution. Some of the identification results bear resemblance to identification results in the literature on direct and indirect effects. We describe some settings in which ignoring multiple versions of treatment, even when present, will not lead to incorrect inferences.},

This is a different model than a latent growth curve model with autoregressive relationships between the disturbances. However, when the autoregressive parameter is invariant over time and lies between-1 and 1, it can be shown that these models are algebraically equivalent. This result can be shown to generalize to the multivariate case. When the autoregressive parameters in the autoregressive latent trajectory model vary over time, the equivalence between the autoregressive latent trajectory model and a latent growth curve model with autoregressive disturbances no longer holds. However, a latent growth curve model with time-varying autoregressive parameters for the disturbances could be considered an interesting alternative to the autoregressive latent trajectory model with time-varying autoregressive parameters.},

However, it is unclear which processes mediate the effect of low self-esteem. To test for the mediating effect of rumination, the authors used longitudinal mediation models, which included exclusively prospective effects and controlled for autoregressive effects of the constructs. Data came from 663 individuals (aged 16 to 62 years), who were assessed 5 times over an 8-month period. The results indicated that low self-esteem predicted subsequent rumination, which in turn predicted subsequent depression, and that rumination partially mediated the prospective effect of low self-esteem on depression. These findings held for both men and women, and for both affective-cognitive and somatic symptoms of depression. Future studies should test for the mediating effects of additional intrapersonal and interpersonal processes.},

We argue that the autoregressive and trajectory models are special cases of a more encompassing model that we call the autoregressive latent trajectory (ALT) model. In this paper we detail the underlying statistical theory and mathematical identification of this model, and demonstrate the ALT model using two empirical data sets. The first reanalyzes a simulated repeated measures data set that was previously used to argue against the autoregressive model, and we illustrate how the ALT model can recover the true latent curve model. Second, we apply the ALT model to real family income data on N=3912 adults over a seven year period and find evidence for both autoregressive and latent trajectory processes.

            Marginal Structural Models (MSMs), with the associated method of inverse probability weighting (IPW), have become increasingly popular in epidemiology to model and estimate the joint effects of a sequence of exposures. This popularity is largely related to the relative simplicity of the method, as compared to other techniques to adjust for time-varying confounding, such as g-estimation and g-computation. However, the price to pay for this simplicity can be substantial. The IPW estimators that are routinely used in applications make inefficient use of the information in the data, and are susceptible to large finite-sample bias when some confounders are strongly predictive of exposure. Moreover, the handling of continuous exposures easily becomes impractical, and the study of effect modification by time-varying covariates even impossible. In view of this, we revisit Structural Nested Mean Models (SNMMs) with the associated method of g-estimation as a useful remedy, and show how this can be implemented through standard software.},

              This study examined the transactional interplay among dimensions of destructive interparental conflict (i.e., hostility and dysphoria), children's emotional insecurity, and their psychological problems from middle childhood and adolescence. Participants were 232 families, with the first of five measurement occasions occurring when children were in first grade (
              M
              age = 7 years). Cross-lagged, autoregressive models were conducted with a multiple-method, multiple-informant measurement approach to identify developmental cascades of interparental and child cascades. Results indicated that emotional insecurity was a particularly powerful mediator of prospective associations between interparental conflict (i.e., dysphoria and hostility) and child adjustment during adolescence rather than childhood. In reflecting bidirectionality in relationships between interparental and child functioning, children's psychological problems predicted increases in interparental dysphoria during childhood and adolescence. Although emotional insecurity was not identified as a proximal predictor of interparental difficulties, an indirect cascade was identified whereby insecurity in early adolescence was associated with increases in teen psychological problems, which in turn predicted greater interparental dysphoria over time. Results are interpreted in the context of how they advance transactional formulation of emotional security theory and its resulting translational implications for clinical initiatives.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Background:
              Cognitive ability and problem behaviour (externalising and internalising problems) are variable and inter-related in children. However, it is not known if they mutually influence one another, if difficulties in one cause difficulties in the other, or if they are related only because they share causes.
            
            
              Methods:
              Random-intercept cross-lagged models adjusted for confounding were fitted to explore this in 17,318 (51\% male) children of the UK’s Millennium Cohort Study at ages 3, 5, 7, 11 and 14 years. Externalising and internalising problems were assessed using the parent-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Cognitive ability was measured using standardised scores of age-appropriate validated cognitive ability assessments. Where multiple cognitive assessments were available a single score was derived using principal components analysis.
            
            
              Results:
              There was much evidence for cross-domain longitudinal effects in childhood, especially for cognitive ability (on both internalising and externalising problems and in both males and females) and externalising problems (on internalising problems in both genders and cognitive ability in males). Bidirectional effects were childhood-limited, gender-specific and less consistent. The consistent bidirectional associations were, in males, between externalising problems and cognitive ability, and, in females, between externalising and internalising problems (although the effects of internalising problems were weak). In adolescence, only externalising problems had cross-domain effects such that, in both genders, they were associated with lower cognitive ability in subsequent measurements and increased levels of internalising problems.
            
            
              Conclusions:
              In either childhood or adolescence, reducing behavioural problems could have both emotional and cognitive benefits. In childhood, improving cognitive skills could reduce both emotional and behavioural problems.},

	abstract = {Researchers often combine longitudinal panel data analysis with tests of interactions (i.e., moderation). A popular example is the cross-lagged panel model (CLPM). However, interaction tests in CLPMs and related models require caution because stable (i.e., between-level, B) and dynamic (i.e., within-level, W) sources of variation are present in longitudinal data, which can conflate estimates of interaction effects. We address this by integrating literature on CLPMs, multilevel moderation, and latent interactions. Distinguishing stable B and dynamic W parts, we describe three types of interactions that are of interest to researchers: 1) purely dynamic or WxW; 2) cross-level or BxW; and 3) purely stable or BxB. We demonstrate estimating latent interaction effects in a CLPM using a Bayesian SEM in Mplus to apply relationships among work-family conflict and job satisfaction, using gender as a stable B variable. We support our approach via simulations, demonstrating that our proposed CLPM approach is superior to a traditional CLPMs that conflate B and W sources of variation. We describe higher-order nonlinearities as a possible extension, and we discuss limitations and future research directions.},

Additionally, I demonstrate how randomization of the mediator and instrumental variables methods lead to fundamentally different quantities than causal mediation analyses. I also review recent work that discusses how the assumptions of mediation analyses differ when there is treatment noncompliance or when there are multiple mediators.

Little is known about the development of aggression regulation following social feedback during childhood, while this is an important period for both brain maturation and social relations. The current study used a longitudinal design, with 456 twins undergoing two functional MRI sessions across the transition from middle (7 to 9 y) to late (9 to 11 y) childhood. Aggression regulation was studied using the Social Network Aggression Task. Behavioral aggression after social evaluation decreased over time, whereas activation in the insula, dorsomedial PFC and DLPFC increased over time. Brain–behavior analyses showed that increased DLPFC activation after negative feedback was associated with decreased aggression. Change analyses further revealed that children with larger increases in DLPFC activity from middle to late childhood showed stronger decreases in aggression over time.

            Social belonging is an important human drive that influences mood and behavior. Neural responses to social exclusion are well-characterized, but the specificity of these responses to processing rejection-related affective distress is unknown. The present study compares neural responses to exclusion and over-inclusion, a condition that similarly violates fairness expectations but does not involve rejection, with a focus on implications for models of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and anterior insula (AI) function. In an fMRI adaptation of the Cyberball paradigm with adolescents 11.1-17.7 years of age (N=69), we employed parametric modulators to examine scaling of neural signal with cumulative exclusion and inclusion events, an approach that overcomes arbitrary definitions of condition onsets/offsets imposed on fluid, continuous gameplay. We identified positive scaling of dACC and posterior insula response with cumulative exclusion events, but these same regions exhibited trending signal
            decreases
            with cumulative inclusion events. Furthermore, areas within the dACC and insula also responded to context incongruency (throws to the participant in the exclusion run; throws between computer players in the over-inclusion run). Taken together, these findings caution against interpretations that responses in these regions uniquely reflect aspects of affective distress within social rejection paradigms. We further identified that the left ventrolateral PFC, rostromedial PFC, and left intraparietal sulcus responded similarly to cumulative exclusion and inclusion. These findings shed light on which neural regions exhibit patterns of differential sensitivity to exclusion or over-inclusion, as well as those that are more broadly engaged by both types of social interaction.},

              Social interaction inherently involves the subjective evaluation of cues salient to social inclusion and exclusion. Testifying to the importance of such social cues, parts of the neural system dedicated to the detection of physical pain, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and anterior insula (AI), have been shown to be equally sensitive to the detection of social pain experienced after social exclusion. However, recent work suggests that this dACC-AI matrix may index
              any
              socially pertinent information. We directly tested the hypothesis that the dACC-AI would respond to cues of
              both
              inclusion and exclusion, using a novel social feedback fMRI paradigm in a population-derived sample of adolescents. We show that the dACC and left AI are commonly activated by feedback cues of inclusion and exclusion. Our findings suggest that theoretical accounts of the dACC-AI network as a neural alarm system restricted within the social domain to the processing of signals of exclusion require significant revision.},

            This study investigated behavioral and neural correlates underlying social feedback processing and subsequent aggressive behaviors in childhood in two age cohorts (test sample: n = 509/n = 385 and replication sample: n = 354/n = 195, 7–9 years old). Using a previously validated Social Network Aggression Task, we showed that negative social feedback resulted in most behavioral aggression, followed by less aggression after neutral and least aggression after positive feedback. Receiving positive and negative social feedback was associated with increased activity in the insula, medial prefrontal cortex and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. Responding to feedback was associated with additional activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) following positive feedback. This DLPFC activation correlated negatively with aggression. Furthermore, age analyses showed that older children showed larger reductions in aggression following positive feedback and more neural activation in the DLPFC when responding to positive feedback compared to younger children. To assess the robustness of our results, we examined these processes in two independent behavioral/functional magnetic resonance imaging samples using equivalence testing, thereby contributing to replicable reports. Together, these findings demonstrate an important role of social saliency and regulatory processes where regulation of aggression rapidly develops between the ages of 7 and 9 years.},

            The development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques has defined modern neuroimaging. Since its inception, tens of thousands of studies using techniques such as functional MRI and diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the non-invasive study of the brain. Despite the fact that MRI is routinely used to obtain data for neuroscience research, there has been no widely adopted standard for organizing and describing the data collected in an imaging experiment. This renders sharing and reusing data (within or between labs) difficult if not impossible and unnecessarily complicates the application of automatic pipelines and quality assurance protocols. To solve this problem, we have developed the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), a standard for organizing and describing MRI datasets. The BIDS standard uses file formats compatible with existing software, unifies the majority of practices already common in the field, and captures the metadata necessary for most common data processing operations.},

In the present multi-sample mixed method study we developed a novel assessment tool of adolescent wellbeing, the Adolescent Wellbeing Paradigm (AWP). In Study 1, an online survey study among Dutch-speaking adolescents and young adults (N = 339, Mage = 18.44 years, SD = 3.53, 79\% females) was conducted to inspect which initial AWP-items were viewed as being important for their wellbeing. In Study 2, we co-evaluated the original AWP-items and co-created new items with adolescents and young adults (N = 25) via focus groups. In Study 3, we examined the validity and reliability of the updated AWP in a new sample of youth (Mage = 19.86 years, SD = 4.46, 71\% females). Principal Components Analyses revealed five factors of adolescent wellbeing: 1) having impact, purpose, and meaning; 2) absence of (excessive) stress; 3) family relationships; 4) self-confidence; and 5) feeling respected, appreciated, and loved. These AWP-factors were related to other measures of mental health and wellbeing, and the AWP showed good internal consistency and test-retest reliability. In conclusion, the AWP was found to be a valid and reliable measure of adolescent wellbeing.},

	abstract = {How similar are the experiences of social rejection and physical pain? Extant research suggests that a network of brain regions that support the affective but not the sensory components of physical pain underlie both experiences. Here we demonstrate that when rejection is powerfully elicited—by having people who recently experienced an unwanted break-up view a photograph of their ex-partner as they think about being rejected—areas that support the sensory components of physical pain (secondary somatosensory cortex; dorsal posterior insula) become active. We demonstrate the overlap between social rejection and physical pain in these areas by comparing both conditions in the same individuals using functional MRI. We further demonstrate the specificity of the secondary somatosensory cortex and dorsal posterior insula activity to physical pain by comparing activated locations in our study with a database of over 500 published studies. Activation in these regions was highly diagnostic of physical pain, with positive predictive values up to 88\%. These results give new meaning to the idea that rejection “hurts.” They demonstrate that rejection and physical pain are similar not only in that they are both distressing—they share a common somatosensory representation as well.},

              Our review examines the current state of the research on hot executive function (EF), as contrasted with cool EF, with regard to the evidence for construct validity. Current theoretical discussions have examined the conceptual overlap among constructs such as hot EF, effortful control, self-control, and self-regulation. We explore this emerging literature with a focus on research questions, tasks, and methods. Finally, we consider the unresolved questions facing the study of hot EF, most notably the difficulty in determining the relative “heat” of a given task based on task content, testing context, and the individual differences among the participants.

Critics of the CLPM have noted that by failing to account for certain person-level associations, estimates of these causal effects can be biased. Because of this, models that incorporate stable-trait components (e.g., the random-intercept CLPM) have become popular alternatives. Debates about the merits of the CLPM have continued, however, with some researchers arguing that the CLPM is more appropriate than modern alternatives for examining common psychological questions. In this article, I discuss the ways that these defenses of the CLPM fail to acknowledge well-known limitations of the model. I propose some possible sources of confusion regarding these models and provide alternative ways of thinking about the problems with the CLPM. I then show in simulated data that with realistic assumptions, the CLPM is very likely to find spurious cross-lagged effects when they do not exist and can sometimes underestimate these effects when they do exist.},

            Network analysis of ESM data has become popular in clinical psychology. In this approach, discrete-time (DT) vector auto-regressive (VAR) models define the network structure with centrality measures used to identify intervention targets. However, VAR models suffer from time-interval dependency. Continuous-time (CT) models have been suggested as an alternative but require a conceptual shift, implying that DT-VAR parameters reflect total rather than direct effects. In this paper, we propose and illustrate a CT network approach using CT-VAR models. We define a new network representation and develop centrality measures which inform intervention targeting. This methodology is illustrated with an ESM dataset.},

              Transactional processes between parental support and adolescents’ depressive symptoms might differ in the short term versus long term.

              M
              age
              = 14.4 years, 29\% male), three-monthly (
              N
              = 245,
              M
              age
              = 13.9 years, 38\% male), annual (

              M
              age
              = 13.8 years, 48\% male). Preregistered random-intercept cross-lagged panel models (RI-CLPMs) showed negative between- and within-family correlations. Moreover, although the preregistered models showed no within-family lagged effect from perceived parental support to adolescent depressive symptoms at any timescale, an exploratory model demonstrated a negative lagged effect at a biennial timescale with the annual dataset. Concerning the reverse within-family lagged effect, increases in adolescent depressive symptoms predicted decreases in perceived parental support 2 weeks and 3 months later (relationship erosion effect). Most cross-lagged effects were not moderated by adolescent sex or neuroticism trait level. Thus, the findings mostly support adolescent-driven effects at understudied timescales and illustrate that within-family lagged effects do not generalize across timescales.},

	url = {https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/HDRZC},
	abstract = {During the transition from childhood to emerging adolescence (approximately between the ages of 7-14-years-old) peer relations become more salient. Social emotion regulation, i.e., regulating emotions in social situations, for example after receiving (negative) peer feedback, is an important prerequisite for developing and maintaining peer relations. A broad range of literature has shown that receiving negative social feedback can result in reactive aggression. Recent studies additionally have shown that regulating such aggression is related to neural activation, and both behavioral and neural responses to social emotion regulation develop across childhood and adolescence. However, existing research has focused largely on group-based averages, obscuring meaningful individual variation in development. This ‘aggregate approach’ needlessly eliminates rich information in the form of within-participant variability. To move toward a more nuanced understanding of neurocognitive changes, developmental neuroimaging studies need to characterize individual differences as a variable of interest. Therefore, the current study will specifically examine individual differences in developmental trajectories of social emotion regulation. Moreover, to understand the underlying brain mechanisms, we will examine how developmental trajectories of aggression regulation following negative social feedback relate to functional brain development. To address individual variations of developmental trajectories, we will use multi-level models using longitudinal data across three waves during childhood and emerging adolescence.},

To promote adolescent adaptive (‘resilient’) psychosocial functioning (PSF), appropriate conceptualisation and quantification of such functioning and its predictors is a crucial first step. Here, we quantify resilient functioning as the degree to which an individual functions better or worse than expected given their self-reported childhood family experiences, and relate this to adolescent family and friendship support.
            
            
              Method
              
                We used Principal Component and regression analyses to investigate the relationship between childhood family experiences and PSF (psychiatric symptomatology, personality traits and mental wellbeing) in healthy adolescents (the Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network;
                N
                = 2389; ages 14–24). Residuals from the relation between childhood family experiences and PSF reflect resilient functioning; the degree to which an individual is functioning better, or worse, than expected given their childhood family experiences. Next, we relate family and friendship support with resilient functioning both cross-sectionally and 1 year later.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                Friendship and family support were positive predictors of immediate resilient PSF, with friendship support being the strongest predictor. However, whereas friendship support was a significant positive predictor of
                later
                resilient functioning,
                family
                support had a
                negative
                relationship with later resilient PSF.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              We show that friendship support, but not family support, is an important positive predictor of both immediate and later resilient PSF in adolescence and early adulthood. Interventions that promote the skills needed to acquire and sustain adolescent friendships may be crucial in increasing adolescent resilient PSF.},

	abstract = {Whenever we measure a psychological variable for multiple persons we typically capture both stable differences between persons, resulting in ``between-person variance'', and fluctuations within a person over time, resulting in ``within-person variance''. Both types of variance are of key interest to psychology: Stable differences between persons are the main interest in psychological research on, for example, traits and risk factors. Variation in variables over time are the main interest in studies that focus on psychological processes, change, and development.  Failing to distinguishing between these sources of variance in our data can quickly result in wrong conclusions about both types of variation. This is an essential problem for all studies with data from multiple persons – cross-sectional and longitudinal. However, for many psychologists the problem with failing to distinguish within- and between-person variance remains obscure. My aim is to provide an entry-level review of the problem: To elucidate related jargon, the potential consequences of the problem, and various practical solutions to it. To illustrate the problem, I provide an online app in which researchers can change various settings to see how they influence the conclusions of analyses.},

Monte Carlo simulations show that the ML-SEM method is less biased and more efficient than the GMM method under a wide range of conditions. ML-SEM also makes it possible to test and relax many of the constraints that are typically embodied in dynamic panel models.},

              Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has transformed our understanding of the human brain through well-replicated mapping of abilities to specific structures (for example, lesion studies) and functions
              1–3
              (for example, task functional MRI (fMRI)). Mental health research and care have yet to realize similar advances from MRI. A primary challenge has been replicating associations between inter-individual differences in brain structure or function and complex cognitive or mental health phenotypes (brain-wide association studies (BWAS)). Such BWAS have typically relied on sample sizes appropriate for classical brain mapping
              4
              (the median neuroimaging study sample size is about 25), but potentially too small for capturing reproducible brain–behavioural phenotype associations
              5,6
              . Here we used three of the largest neuroimaging datasets currently available—with a total sample size of around 50,000 individuals—to quantify BWAS effect sizes and reproducibility as a function of sample size. BWAS associations were smaller than previously thought, resulting in statistically underpowered studies, inflated effect sizes and replication failures at typical sample sizes. As sample sizes grew into the thousands, replication rates began to improve and effect size inflation decreased. More robust BWAS effects were detected for functional MRI (versus structural), cognitive tests (versus mental health questionnaires) and multivariate methods (versus univariate). Smaller than expected brain–phenotype associations and variability across population subsamples can explain widespread BWAS replication failures. In contrast to non-BWAS approaches with larger effects (for example, lesions, interventions and within-person), BWAS reproducibility requires samples with thousands of individuals.},

This article discusses causal inference based on observational data, introducing readers to graphical causal models that can provide a powerful tool for thinking more clearly about the interrelations between variables. Topics covered include the rationale behind the statistical control of third variables, common procedures for statistical control, and what can go wrong during their implementation. Certain types of third variables—colliders and mediators—should not be controlled for because that can actually move the estimate of an association away from the value of the causal effect of interest. More subtle variations of such harmful control include using unrepresentative samples, which can undermine the validity of causal conclusions, and statistically controlling for mediators. Drawing valid causal inferences on the basis of observational data is not a mechanistic procedure but rather always depends on assumptions that require domain knowledge and that can be more or less plausible. However, this caveat holds not only for research based on observational data, but for all empirical research endeavors.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Background
              Childhood maltreatment has been associated with significant impairment in social, emotional and behavioural functioning later in life. Nevertheless, some individuals who have experienced childhood maltreatment function better than expected given their circumstances.
            
            
              Main body
              Here, we provide an integrated understanding of the complex, interrelated mechanisms that facilitate such individual resilient functioning after childhood maltreatment. We aim to show that resilient functioning is not facilitated by any single ‘resilience biomarker’. Rather, resilient functioning after childhood maltreatment is a product of complex processes and influences across multiple levels, ranging from ‘bottom-up’ polygenetic influences, to ‘top-down’ supportive social influences. We highlight the complex nature of resilient functioning and suggest how future studies could embrace a complexity theory approach and investigate multiple levels of biological organisation and their temporal dynamics in a longitudinal or prospective manner. This would involve using methods and tools that allow the characterisation of resilient functioning trajectories, attractor states and multidimensional/multilevel assessments of functioning. Such an approach necessitates large, longitudinal studies on the neurobiological mechanisms of resilient functioning after childhood maltreatment that cut across and integrate multiple levels of explanation (i.e. genetics, endocrine and immune systems, brain structure and function, cognition and environmental factors) and their temporal interconnections.
            
            
              Conclusion
              We conclude that a turn towards complexity is likely to foster collaboration and integration across fields. It is a promising avenue which may guide future studies aimed to promote resilience in those who have experienced childhood maltreatment.},

              Child and adolescent adversity (‘CA’) is a major predictor of mental health problems in adolescence and early adulthood. However, not all young people who have experienced CA develop psychopathology; their mental health functioning can be described as
              resilient
              . We previously found that resilient functioning in adolescence following CA is facilitated by adolescent friendships. However, during adolescence, friendships undergo significant change. It is unknown whether resilient functioning after CA fluctuates with these normative changes in friendship quality. We used Latent Change Score Modelling in a large sample of adolescents (i.e. the ROOTS cohort;
              N
               = 1238) to examine whether and how emergent friendship quality and resilient functioning at ages 14 and 17 inter-relate and change together. We found that friendships quality and resilient functioning had strong associations at age 14, although friendships at 14 did not predict higher resilient functioning at 17. Higher resilient functioning in 14-year-olds with a history of CA was associated with a positive change in friendships from age 14 to 17. Finally, improvements in friendship quality and resilient functioning went hand-in-hand, even when taking into account baseline levels of both, the change within friendship quality or resilient functioning over time, and the association between resilient functioning and change in friendship quality over time. We show that friendship quality and resilient functioning after CA inter-relate and change together between ages 14 and 17. Our results suggest that improving friendship quality or resilient functioning within this timeframe may benefit this vulnerable adolescent group, and this should be tested in future research.},

The translational potential from these advances is unparalleled, as a better understanding of complex human brain functions is best grounded in the onset of these functions during human development.

The initial score of the SUDS at the first session was significantly correlated with the patient’s level of depression, the state anxiety, and distress from the impact of events. The final score of the SUDS at the first session was significantly correlated with the CGI-C score at termination.

              Aims
              To compare the efficacy and response pattern of a trauma-focused CBT modality, brief eclectic psychotherapy for PTSD, with EMDR (trial registration: ISRCTN64872147).

                n
                = 70) or EMDR (
                n
                = 70) and assessed at all sessions on self-reported PTSD (Impact of Event Scale – Revised). Other outcomes were clinician-rated PTSD, anxiety and depression.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                Both treatments were equally effective in reducing PTSD symptom severity, but the response pattern indicated that EMDR led to a significantly sharper decline in PTSD symptoms than brief eclectic psychotherapy, with similar drop-out rates (EMDR:
                n
                = 20 (29\%), brief eclectic psychotherapy:
                n
                = 25 (36\%)). Other outcome measures confirmed this pattern of results.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              Although both treatments are effective, EMDR results in a faster recovery compared with the more gradual improvement with brief eclectic psychotherapy.},

Third, it is empirically demonstrated, using Random-Intercept Cross-Lagged Models, how distinguishing between-person and within-person associations may alter or strengthen conclusions regarding the links of parental monitoring and adolescent disclosure with adolescent delinquency. Previously detected correlations between parental monitoring and adolescent delinquency were not present at the within-family level. However, there were significant associations between within-person fluctuations in disclosure and delinquency. Together, these models provide stronger evidence for a potential causal link between disclosure and delinquency, but also suggest that previously detected linkages of parental monitoring and delinquency can be explained by stable between-person differences rather than causal processes operating within families.},

Analyzing data describing day-to-day social interaction is used to illustrate the analysis of event-contingent data (when specific events trigger or organize data collection), and analyzing data describing reactions to daily events is used to illustrate the analysis of interval-contingent data (when data are collected at intervals). Different analytic strategies are presented, the shortcomings of ordinary least squares analyses are described, and the use of multilevel random coefficient modeling is discussed in detail. Different modeling techniques, the specifics of formulating and testing hypotheses, and the differences between fixed and random effects are also considered.},

	abstract = {This article addresses the approximate approach to assess measurement invariance with 
(longitudinal) confirmatory factor analysis. Approximate measurement invariance uses 
zero-mean, small-variance Bayesian priors to allow minor differences in estimated 
parameters across time, while still maintaining comparability of the underlying constructs. 
The procedure is illustrated for the first time with panel data on young peoples’ preferences 
to maximize pleasure and enjoy life. Results indicate whereas the traditional approach of 
exact measurement invariance failed to establish scalar invariance across time and precluded 
comparisons of latent means, it was possible to establish approximate scalar invariance. 
Based on a monitoring procedure for model fit and convergence, a rather small prior variance 
was deemed sufficient to account for minor deviations of cross-time intercept differences 
from zero.},

Let model M a be the base model within which model M b is nested. In practice, this test is commonly used to justify M b even when M a is misspecified. The authors study the behavior of the chi-square difference test in such a circumstance. Monte Carlo results indicate that a nonsignificant chi-square difference cannot be used to justify the constraints in M b. They also show that when the base model is misspecified, the z test for the statistical significance of a parameter estimate can also be misleading. For specific models, the analysis further shows that the intercept and slope parameters in growth curve models can be estimated consistently even when the covariance structure is misspecified, but only in linear growth models. Similarly, with misspecified covariance structures, the mean parameters in multiple group models can be estimated consistently under null conditions.},

This paper aims to assess the distributional shape of real data by examining the values of the third and fourth central moments as a measurement of skewness and kurtosis in small samples. The analysis concerned 693 distributions with a sample size ranging from 10 to 30. Measures of cognitive ability and of other psychological variables were included. The results showed that skewness ranged between −2.49 and 2.33. The values of kurtosis ranged between −1.92 and 7.41. Considering skewness and kurtosis together the results indicated that only 5.5\% of distributions were close to expected values under normality. Although extreme contamination does not seem to be very frequent, the findings are consistent with previous research suggesting that normality is not the rule with real data.},

              Conducting a power analysis can be challenging for researchers who plan to analyze their data using structural equation models (SEMs), particularly when Monte Carlo methods are used to obtain power. In this tutorial, we explain how power calculations without Monte Carlo methods for the χ

              test and the RMSEA tests of (not-)close fit can be conducted using the Shiny app “power4SEM”. power4SEM facilitates power calculations for SEM using two methods that are not computationally intensive and that focus on model fit instead of the statistical significance of (functions of) parameters. These are the method proposed by Satorra and Saris (Psychometrika 50(1), 83–90, 1985) for power calculations of the likelihood ratio test, and that described by MacCallum, Browne, and Sugawara (Psychol Methods 1(2) 130–149, 1996) for RMSEA-based power calculations. We illustrate the use of power4SEM with examples of power analyses for path models, factor models, and a latent growth model.},

Based on classical and contemporary theories, a strong link between alienation and amotivation was predicted. A cross-sectional correlation study (Study 1) found that SA significantly predicted AA controlling for relevant variables (e.g., self-efficacy). A four-wave longitudinal design (Study 2) tested the reciprocal relationship between SA and AA within persons. Contrary to the a priori hypothesis that SA would predict amotivation, the path from AA to SA was more consistent and reliable than the other path. The potential bidirectional links between SA and AA, implications, and future directions are discussed.},

Emotional inertia refers to the degree to which emotional states are resistant to change. Because psychological maladjustment has been associated with both emotional underreactivity and ineffective emotion-regulation skills, we hypothesized that its overall emotion dynamics would be characterized by high levels of inertia. We provide evidence from two naturalistic studies that, using different methods, showed that the emotional fluctuations of individuals who exhibited low self-esteem (Study 1) and depression (Study 2) were characterized by higher levels of inertia in both positive and negative emotions than the emotional fluctuations of people who did not exhibit low self-esteem and depression. We also discuss the usefulness of the concept of emotional inertia as a hallmark of maladaptive emotion dynamics.},

This article is intended to provide concrete examples for automating a Monte Carlo simulation study using some standard software packages for SEM: Mplus, LISREL, SAS PROC CALIS, and R package lavaan. Also, the equivalence between the multilevel SEM and hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) is discussed, and relevant examples are provided.

Psychologists have traditionally thought of sample size planning in terms of power analysis. Although we review recent advances in power analysis, our main focus is the desirability of achieving accurate parameter estimates, either instead of or in addition to obtaining sufficient power. Accuracy in parameter estimation (AIPE) has taken on increasing importance in light of recent emphasis on effect size estimation and formation of confidence intervals. The review provides an overview of the logic behind sample size planning for AIPE and summarizes recent advances in implementing this approach in designs commonly used in psychological research.},

This study used Monte Carlo data simulation techniques to evaluate sample size requirements for common applied SEMs. Across a series of simulations, we systematically varied key model properties, including number of indicators and factors, magnitude of factor loadings and path coefficients, and amount of missing data. We investigated how changes in these parameters affected sample size requirements with respect to statistical power, bias in the parameter estimates, and overall solution propriety. Results revealed a range of sample size requirements (i.e., from 30 to 460 cases), meaningful patterns of association between parameters and sample size, and highlight the limitations of commonly cited rules-of-thumb.

            This paper examines the relationship between self-esteem in adolescence and later mental health, substance use, and life and relationship outcomes in adulthood. The investigation analyzed data from a birth cohort of approximately 1,000 New Zealand young adults studied to the age of 25. Lower levels of self-esteem at age 15 were associated with greater risks of mental health problems, substance dependence, and lower levels of life and relationship satisfaction at ages 18, 21, and 25. Adjustment for potentially confounding factors reduced the strength of these associations to either moderate or statistically nonsignificant levels. It was concluded that the effects of self-esteem during adolescence on later developmental outcomes were weak, and largely explained by the psychosocial context within which self-esteem develops.},

We found neuroticism accounted for the majority of covariance between depression and self-esteem, to the degree that the scar and vulnerability models appear to be inadequate explanations for the relation between depression and self-esteem.

	abstract = {Summary
            When regression models adjust for mediators on the causal path from exposure to outcome, the regression coefficient of exposure is commonly viewed as a measure of the direct exposure effect. This interpretation can be misleading, even with a randomly assigned exposure. This is because adjustment for post-exposure measurements introduces bias whenever their association with the outcome is confounded by more than just the exposure. By the same token, adjustment for such confounders stays problematic when these are themselves affected by the exposure. Robins accommodated this by introducing linear structural nested direct effect models with direct effect parameters that can be estimated by using inverse probability weighting by a conditional distribution of the mediator. The resulting estimators are consistent, but inefficient, and can be extremely unstable when the mediator is absolutely continuous. We develop direct effect estimators which are not only more efficient but also consistent under a less demanding model for a conditional expectation of the outcome. We find that the one estimator which avoids inverse probability weighting altogether performs best. This estimator is intuitive, computationally straightforward and, as demonstrated by simulation, competes extremely well with ordinary least squares estimators in settings where standard regression is valid.},

	abstract = {Many psychological researchers use some form of a visual diagram in their research processes. Model diagrams used with structural equation models (SEMs) and causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) can guide causal-inference research. SEM diagrams and DAGs share visual similarities, often leading researchers familiar with one to wonder how the other differs. This article is intended to serve as a guide for researchers in the psychological sciences and psychiatric epidemiology on the distinctions between these methods. We offer high-level overviews of SEMs and causal DAGs using a guiding example. We then compare and contrast the two methodologies and describe when each would be used. In brief, SEM diagrams are both a conceptual and statistical tool in which a model is drawn and then tested, whereas causal DAGs are exclusively conceptual tools used to help guide researchers in developing an analytic strategy and interpreting results. Causal DAGs are explicitly tools for causal inference, whereas the results of a SEM are only sometimes interpreted causally. A DAG may be thought of as a “qualitative schematic” for some SEMs, whereas SEMs may be thought of as an “algebraic system” for a causal DAG. As psychology begins to adopt more causal-modeling concepts and psychiatric epidemiology begins to adopt more latent-variable concepts, the ability of researchers to understand and possibly combine both of these tools is valuable. Using an applied example, we provide sample analyses, code, and write-ups for both SEM and causal DAG approaches.},

              Purpose
              Ideally, the objectives of a pharmacoepidemiologic comparative effectiveness or safety study should dictate its design and data analysis. This paper discusses how defining an estimand is instrumental to this process.
            
            
              Methods
              
                We applied the ICH‐E9 (
                Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials
                ) R1 addendum on estimands – which originally focused on randomized trials – to three examples of observational pharmacoepidemiologic comparative effectiveness and safety studies. Five key elements specify the estimand: the population, contrasted treatments, endpoint, intercurrent events, and population‐level summary measure.
              
            
            
              Results
              Different estimands were defined for case studies representing three types of pharmacological treatments: (1) single‐dose treatments using a case study about the effect of influenza vaccination versus no vaccination on mortality risk in an adult population of ≥60 years of age; (2) sustained‐treatments using a case study about the effect of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor versus glucagon‐like peptide‐1 agonist on hypoglycemia risk in treatment of uncontrolled diabetes; and (3) as needed treatments using a case study on the effect of nitroglycerin spray as‐needed versus no nitroglycerin on syncope risk in treatment of stabile angina pectoris.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The case studies illustrated that a seemingly clear research question can still be open to multiple interpretations. Defining an estimand ensures that the study targets a treatment effect that aligns with the treatment decision the study aims to inform. Estimand definitions further help to inform choices regarding study design and data‐analysis and clarify how to interpret study findings.},

              Purpose
              In studies of effects of time‐varying drug exposures, adequate adjustment for time‐varying covariates is often necessary to properly control for confounding. However, the granularity of the available covariate data may not be sufficiently fine, for example when covariates are measured for participants only when their exposure levels change.
            
            
              Methods
              To illustrate the impact of choices regarding the frequency of measuring time‐varying covariates, we simulated data for a large target trial and for large observational studies, varying in covariate measurement design. Covariates were measured never, on a fixed‐interval basis, or each time the exposure level switched. For the analysis, it was assumed that covariates remain constant in periods of no measurement. Cumulative survival probabilities for continuous exposure and non‐exposure were estimated using inverse probability weighting to adjust for time‐varying confounding, with special emphasis on the difference between 5‐year event risks.
            
            
              Results
              With monthly covariate measurements, estimates based on observational data coincided with trial‐based estimates, with 5‐year risk differences being zero. Without measurement of baseline or post‐baseline covariates, this risk difference was estimated to be 49\% based on the available observational data. With measurements on a fixed‐interval basis only, 5‐year risk differences deviated from the null, to 29\% for 6‐monthly measurements, and with magnitude increasing up to 35\% as the interval length increased. Risk difference estimates diverged from the null to as low as −18\% when covariates were measured depending on exposure level switching.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Our simulations highlight the need for careful consideration of time‐varying covariates in designing studies on time‐varying exposures. We caution against implementing designs with long intervals between measurements. The maximum length required will depend on the rates at which treatments and covariates change, with higher rates requiring shorter measurement intervals.},

            Selecting an appropriate set of confounders for which to control is critical for reliable causal inference. Recent theoretical and methodological developments have helped clarify a number of principles of confounder selection. When complete knowledge of a causal diagram relating all covariates to each other is available, graphical rules can be used to make decisions about covariate control. Unfortunately, such complete knowledge is often unavailable. This paper puts forward a practical approach to confounder selection decisions when the somewhat less stringent assumption is made that knowledge is available for each covariate whether it is a cause of the exposure, and whether it is a cause of the outcome. Based on recent theoretically justified developments in the causal inference literature, the following proposal is made for covariate control decisions: control for each covariate that is a cause of the exposure, or of the outcome, or of both; exclude from this set any variable known to be an instrumental variable; and include as a covariate any proxy for an unmeasured variable that is a common cause of both the exposure and the outcome. Various principles of confounder selection are then further related to statistical covariate selection methods.},

The first is error of approximation which involves the fit of the model, with optimally chosen but unknown parameter values, to the population covariance matrix. The second is overall error which involves the fit of the model, with parameter values estimated from the sample, to the population covariance matrix. Measures of the two types of error are proposed and point and interval estimates of the measures are suggested. These measures take the number of parameters in the model into account in order to avoid penalizing parsimonious models. Practical difficulties associated with the usual tests of exact fit or a model are discussed and a test of “close fit” of a model is suggested.},

	abstract = {Background:
              Causal inference continues to be a critical aspect of evaluation research. Recent research in causal inference for statistical mediation has focused on addressing the sequential ignorability assumption; specifically, that there is no confounding between the mediator and the outcome variable.
            
            
              Objectives:
              This article compares and contrasts three different methods for assessing sensitivity to confounding and describes the graphical depiction of these methods.
            
            
              Design:
              Two types of data were used to fully examine the plots for sensitivity analysis. The first type was generated data from a single mediator model with a confounder influencing both the mediator and the outcome variable. The second was data from an actual intervention study. With both types of data, situations are examined where confounding has a large effect and a small effect.
            
            
              Subjects:
              The nonsimulated data were from a large intervention study to decrease intentions to use steroids among high school football players. We demonstrate one situation where confounding is likely and another situation where confounding is unlikely.
            
            
              Conclusions:
              We discuss how these methods could be implemented in future mediation studies as well as the limitations and future directions for these methods.},

Major themes emphasized are the problem of omitted variables, the importance of lower-order model components, potential limitations of models judged to be well fitting, the inaccuracy of some commonly used rules of thumb, and the importance of study design.

A key strength of simulation studies is the ability to understand the behavior of statistical methods because some “truth” (usually some parameter/s of interest) is known from the process of generating the data. This allows us to consider properties of methods, such as bias. While widely used, simulation studies are often poorly designed, analyzed, and reported. This tutorial outlines the rationale for using simulation studies and offers guidance for design, execution, analysis, reporting, and presentation. In particular, this tutorial provides a structured approach for planning and reporting simulation studies, which involves defining aims, data‐generating mechanisms, estimands, methods, and performance measures (“ADEMP”); coherent terminology for simulation studies; guidance on coding simulation studies; a critical discussion of key performance measures and their estimation; guidance on structuring tabular and graphical presentation of results; and new graphical presentations.
